# 16-bit Virtual Machine in Rust

This project is a simple, educational 16-bit virtual machine (VM) written in Rust. It is designed to help you understand how CPUs and low-level computer architecture work by simulating a basic computer system from scratch.

## Project Goals
- Learn the fundamentals of CPU and VM design
- Explore instruction sets, registers, memory, and program execution
- Provide a clear, well-documented codebase for experimentation and learning

## Features
- 16-bit word size for all operations and memory
- General-purpose and special-purpose registers (PC, SP, FLAGS, etc.)
- Simple instruction set (arithmetic, logic, memory access, control flow)
- Memory-mapped I/O and bus abstraction
- Halt and error handling for safe execution

## Architecture Overview

The VM consists of:
- **Registers:** 6 registers (R0–R3 general-purpose, RPC program counter RIR)
- **Memory:** Linear address space, 16-bit words
- **Instruction Set:** Each instruction is 16 bits, with 4 bits for the opcode and the rest for operands
- **Execution Loop:** Fetch-decode-execute cycle, halts on errors or HALT instruction

## Example Usage

Build the project:
```sh
cargo build
```

Run the VM (example, see `main.rs` for entry point):
```sh
cargo run
```
